This is a program that will be able to solve a suduko game:

As of now it can:
- Take in a string (that is preset in the code) and display that string in a suduko board.

To do:
- Instead of having all the numbers in one string, it should be an array. Hopefully this will make solving easier.
- Create a better input method; Create a text file with a suduko template, all you to input it in the command terminal.
- Create solving algorithim; Need to think of a good sorting method rather than brute force.
